# Qt-Exercise

This is my collection of Qt exercise.

Notice that the fold with name "samp xx" is the source code. You should also install Qt if you want to run the code because the "mingw" used to compile Qt project is different from normal mingw for C/C++.

The codes are divided into chapters.



## How to install Qt

Official website: [https://www.qt.io/](https://www.qt.io/)

Qt has community version, so you can download it for free. You can also go to tuna to get a mirror version because it's slow to download it directly from the official website. The link is [https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/qt/archive/qt/](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/qt/archive/qt/), and you can choose a version. You can choose Qt 5.9 because it's an LTS.
