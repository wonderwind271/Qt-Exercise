Chapter 1 is the intro to Qt.

"Samp 1" and "sample1_2" are almost the same, except for the base class. (sample1_2 is QDialog and samp1 is QMainWindow) They are designed by UI design mode inside Qt.

"HelloQt_purecode" is a pure code project, designing the UI without design mode.

"Samp1_4" is a more complex project, using manual signal and multi-window. A lambda function is also applied.
